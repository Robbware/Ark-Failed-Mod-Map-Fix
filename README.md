# Ark-Failed-Mod-Map-Fix

# How to use

# FAQ

* 1 - The application doesn't find any mismatched file but I still get the error.
* A.1) Make sure you add a slash ('/') at the end of your application path. For example: 'D:/Apps/Steam/'

* 2 - I can't delete the folder.
* A.2) To be able to delete the folder without much hassle, you'll have to download a folder unlocker such as IObit Unlocker. The reason why you have to do this is because your Windows User Account does not have permissions to delete those folders and "Unlocking" the files allows you to.
